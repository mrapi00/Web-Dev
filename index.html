	<li>Gauss's Law</li>
	<p> This rule tells us that a charge enclosed by any 3D closed surface experiences a flux of q/epsilon_0. </p>

	<li><p> Ampere's Law <p>
	    <p>Biot-Savart's Law<p></li>
	<p> These are rules that allow to calculate magnetic field from current. In the case of penetrating current, define <strong>dI = JdA</strong> where J(r) is a function of amount of current in <em>circle.</em> <p>
	</ul>

	<h2> Faraday's Law </h2>
	<p class = "custom"> Faraday's law practical runs our economy, and is a consequence of <strong> changing </strong> magnetic flux to induce and electromotive force. </p>
